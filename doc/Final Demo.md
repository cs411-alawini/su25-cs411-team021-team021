# Final Demo

## Changes in the directions of our project
Over the course of the project, we made several adjustments to our plan, such as modifying the feature set and altering the development timeline, based on technical feasibility.
Our original goal was to create a music-mood logging and dynamic playlist recommendation web application that continuously updates based on user interactions.
However, as we iterated on feature scope and schema design, we shifted our emphasis to focus more on mood-centric song recommendations and implemented brief performance optimizations to better meet course requirements and our achievable workload.

## Usefulness

### Achieved
- **Core Functionality:** Successfully implemented mood logging, playlist mapping, and song search features.
- **Data Analysis:** Added features for top song recommendations based on target moods.
- **User Experience:** Provided responsive web UI and quick operations to implemented features.

### Failed
- **Recommendation Engine:** Did not introduce a more sophisticated learning-based collaborative filtering system for song suggestions.
- **Advanced Play History:** Analysis of user listening patterns was not implemented.
- **Community:** We did not implement community sharing feature, as this requires a functional user authentication support.
