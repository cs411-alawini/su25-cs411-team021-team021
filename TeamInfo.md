## Project Summary

MeloMood is a website that is going to aid its users to create playlists based on their current mood, supporting their emotional wellness through music. Through various music services and their APIs (e.g. Spotify, Apple Music), MeloMood uses genre tags and crowdsourced mood ratings to generate playlists that reflect the userâ€™s mood. The platform visualizes individual mood trends and creates a feedback loop between music and emotional wellness. This includes a mood history tracker, allowing users to better understand their moods through music.

Beyond that, users can also contribute to a crowdsourced tagging system, adding their own mood labels and descriptions to songs (possibly assigning mood labels to segments of songs as well). A community hub may also be developed, allowing users to share playlists and connect with others. MeloMood delivers a unique personal experience, going beyond just a simple playlist generator.
